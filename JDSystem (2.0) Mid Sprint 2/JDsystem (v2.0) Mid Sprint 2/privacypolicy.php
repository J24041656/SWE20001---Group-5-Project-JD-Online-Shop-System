 order, and your billing information (where you are purchasing products)). </p>
 <p> We also collect details of your interactions with us through our customer contact centres, in store, online or

     <h2>WHY DO WE NEED YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
     <p>The main purpose for which we use your information is to provide you with the products that you purchase from us

     <p>In particular, we use your information:</p>

         delivery options for your orders) and to ensure that content is presented in the most effective manner;</li>
         <li>to provide you with information that you request from us or which we feel may interest you. We may send you

     </ul>
     <h2>BASIS FOR USING YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
     <p>Compliance with legal obligations</p>
     <p>As a corporate group there are certain laws we need to comply with. In particular, we will need to process your
         personal information to verify your identity and for fraud and crime prevention purposes. Failure to provide the
         requisite personal information on sign-up / as you use our websites and/or mobile apps, may mean we cannot
         provide our products and services to you, as to allow you to purchase our products or access our services may
         mean we may be in breach of our legal obligations. You will not be able to object to processing or ask for the
     deletion of your personal information insofar as it falls under this category.</p>
     <p>Necessary for the entry into or performance of a contract</p>
     <p>When you enter into a transaction with us or one of our brands, a contract between you and the relevant brand
         will have been entered into. In order for us to fulfil our obligations under such contract (e.g. to allow you to
         place an order and receive products from us), we will need to collect and process your personal information.
         Failure to provide the requisite personal information on sign-up to an account or on placing an order and
         payment information or objecting to this type of processing / exercising your deletion rights will mean we
     cannot provide our products to you.</p>
     <p>Legitimate business interests</p>
     <p>We use your personal data as set out in this privacy policy for the legitimate interests of our business to
     enable us to:</p>
     <ul>

         <li>carry out research and analysis to understand our customers and how they purchase and use our products;</li>
         <li>carry out promotions and loyalty programmes, including programmes run jointly with select brand partners;
         </li>
         <li>develop and improve our products, shopping experiences, and interactions with you</li>
     </ul>
     <p>As indicated below, we will also pass your personal data to members of the JD Sports Fashion plc and its group
         companies (together, the "JD Group", more information can be found here: <a class="mailLink"
         href="https://www.jdplc.com/our-group">https://www.jdplc.com/our-group</a>) and other third parties and this
     is also for our legitimate business interests.</p>
     <p>We are required to carry out a balancing test of our legitimate business interests in using your personal data
         outlined above against your interests and rights under the Data Protection Laws and regulations in the relevant
         territory. As a result of our balancing test, which is detailed below, we have determined, acting reasonably and

     business information purposes, to improve our products and services.</p>
     <p>We will also use a number of carefully selected third parties to help us to provide you with products, services
     and to market to you. In particular, we disclose your information to:</p>
     <ul>

         packers and delivery companies;</li>
         <li>Our trusted service providers, such as marketing agencies, advertising partners, website and app hosts and
         other third parties who provide services to help us to tailor our marketing to you; </li>
         <li>Our brand partners and trusted third parties in order to run collaborative promotions, member programmes and
             competitions with them. If you are one of our lucky winners, we may share your data with the brand partner
         or trusted third party in order for them to contact you to deliver the prize to you;</li>
         <li>Credit reference agencies, law enforcement and fraud prevention agencies;</li>

     </ul>
     <p>We will only share your information with third party suppliers where it is necessary for them to provide us with
     the services we need. </p>

     <p>We may also need to disclose personal data to third parties to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation, or
     if necessary for legal proceedings.</p>
     <h2>WHAT AUTOMATED DECISIONS DO WE MAKE ABOUT YOU?</h2>
     <p>We carry out some profiling of you for the purposes of improving and developing our products and services and to
     help us to tailor our marketing to you.</p>
     <p>The impact of any automated decision is to ensure you experience the best service possible.</p>
     <p>We use information that we learn about you such as your gender, preferences, hobbies, interests, purchase history
         and how you engage with the marketing we send to you (as explained above) to make sure the marketing you receive
     from us and the way our websites and mobile apps are displayed to you are appropriate and tailored to you.</p>
     <h2>WHERE IS YOUR INFORMATION STORED AND HOW LONG DO WE KEEP IT FOR?</h2>
     <p>International Transfers</p>
     <p>The information which we collect about you may be transferred outside of your country. In the event of such
         transfer, we will ensure the adequate standard of security is in place for lawful international transfers of
     personal data in your country. </p>
     <p>Retention of your personal data</p>
     <p>We will only keep your information for as long as is necessary to carry out the purposes we collected it for, as
         set out in this privacy policy (unless a longer retention period is required by the applicable law). We
         typically keep your personal data for up to 6 years from the purchase in order to enable us to deal with any
         issues or concerns you may have about the products or services you have received, and to allow us to bring or
         defend legal proceedings. In some circumstances, some of your data will be deleted in much shorter timescales,
     for example:</p>
     <ul>
         <li>cookies are deleted in accordance with our <a class="mailLink"
             href="https://reporting.jdsports.co.uk/cgi-bin/msite?pref_my+a+0+0+0+0+0">cookies policy</a>;</li>
             <li>marketing consents will be refreshed/deleted at regular intervals, however, our aim is only to market to you
             for as long as we believe you want to continue hearing from us based on how you interact with us;</li>
             <li>where local law requirements specify that your personal data must be retained for a shorter period.</li>
         </ul>
         <p>If reasonably necessary or required to meet legal or regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, prevent fraud and
             abuse, or enforce our terms and conditions, we will also keep hold of some of your information, even if it is no
         longer needed to provide our services to you.</p>
         <p>Security of your personal data</p>
         <p>Transmission of information via the internet is not and cannot be completely secure. Although we will do our best
             to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our websites and
             mobile apps; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict
         procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.</p>
         <h2>WHAT NON-PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</h2>
         <p>We may also collect non-personally identifiable information (that is, information that does not specifically
         identify you), for the purposes of aggregates and statistics.</p>
         <h2>WHAT RIGHTS DO YOU HAVE?</h2>
         <p>Depending on your location, you may have a number of rights under the Data Protection Laws in relation to the way
             we process your personal data. You may contact us using the details at the beginning of this privacy policy to
         exercise any of these rights.</p>
         <p>In some instances, we may be unable to carry out your request, in which case we will contact you to explain why.
